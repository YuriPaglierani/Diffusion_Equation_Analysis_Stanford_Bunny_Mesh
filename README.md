# Diffusion_Equation_Analysis_Stanford_Bunny_Mesh
This repository contains an analysis of the application of the Diffusion Equation on the Stanford Bunny Mesh using Chebyshev Polynomials and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). The project explores advanced techniques for smoothing and filtering graph Laplacians to solve the discretized heat equation efficiently on complex mesh data.
